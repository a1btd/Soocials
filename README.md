# Soocials

Soocials.com was a project made for fun in 2015, with the goal to create a search engine for social media platforms.

The idea was to help me with the need of searching for specific topics on multiple social media platofrms. 
It came to be useful and then I decided to publish it online to help others with same needs.

Unfortunately, I lacked time to push it forward and it was not used. 
Due to lack of time I later decided to abandon the project, Soocials was taken down in 2016.

The site was a simple front end, which was using Google APIs.
